if...else if...else statements and switch statements are both used for conditional logic, allowing the program to execute different code blocks based on whether certain conditions are true or false.
if...else if...else statement is a conditional structure that allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute a specific block of code for the first condition that evaluates to true

if (condition1) {
  // Code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code block to execute if condition1 is false AND condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // Code block to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false AND condition3 is true
} else {
  // Code block to execute if all preceding conditions are false
}





if...else if...else Statements
The if statement is the most basic conditional statement. It evaluates a condition and runs a code block if the condition is true. 
if statement: Executes code if a specified condition is true.
else if statement: Checks an alternative condition if the preceding if (and any other else if) condition(s) are false. You can use multiple else if statements to check multiple conditions sequentially.
else statement: Provides a default block of code to execute if none of the preceding if or else if conditions are met
let num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
  console.log("Number is positive.");
} else if (num < 0) {
  console.log("Number is negative.");
} else {
  console.log("Number is zero.");
}


When to use: Use if...else if...else when you need to test a range of values, complex conditions involving logical operators (&&, ||, !), or when the conditions are based on different variables. 

switch Statement
The switch statement is an alternative to a long if...else if...else chain, especially when testing a single expression against many potential fixed values (using strict equality ===). 

switch (expression): Evaluates an expression once.
case value: Compares the expression's result with the specified value. If they match, the associated code block is executed.
break keyword: Crucial for terminating the switch statement after a case is matched. Without break, the code will "fall through" and execute subsequent case blocks.
default keyword: An optional fallback option, similar to the else block. The code inside default executes if no case matches the expression's value.

let day = 3; // Where Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc.

switch (day) {
  case 0:
    console.log("It's Sunday.");
    break;
  case 1:
    console.log("It's Monday.");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("It's Tuesday.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day of the week.");
}





let score = 78;
let grade;

if (score >= 90) {
  grade = "A";
} else if (score >= 80) {
  grade = "B";
} else if (score >= 70) {
  grade = "C";
} else if (score >= 60) {
  grade = "D";
} else {
  grade = "F";
}

console.log("The student's grade is: " + grade);
// Output: The student's grade is: C


















A JavaScript loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. They are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures like arrays and objects, and making code more efficient and organized.
JavaScript provides several types of loops to execute a block of code repeatedly. The primary types are for loops, while loops, and iteration-specific loops like for...in and for...of


for loop: Used when the number of iterations is known, often for iterating over arrays by index.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true, checking the condition before each iteration.
do...while loop: Similar to while, this loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition. 


for...in loop: Iterates over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.
for...of loop: Introduced in ES6, this loop iterates over the values of iterable objects like arrays, strings, Maps, and Sets.
Array.prototype.forEach() method: A method used on arrays to execute a function for each element.




for Loop
The for loop is typically used when you know how many times you want the loop to run. Its syntax includes initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement expression. 

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
}

Explanation:
let i = 0: Initialization. Executed once before the loop starts.
i < 5: Condition. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
i++: Increment. Executed after each iteration of the loop

while Loop
The while loop continues to run as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
  i++; // Increment the counter inside the loop
}
Explanation:
The code block runs repeatedly as long as i is less than 5.
It's crucial to update the loop variable (like i++) within the loop to avoid an infinite loop. 


do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

Explanation:
The do block runs first, then the while condition is evaluated for the next iteration.

for...in Loop
The for...in loop iterates over the properties (keys) of an object. 

const user = {
  name: "foo",
  id: 2,
  isAlive: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(key + ": " + user[key]);
}
Explanation:
This will print each key and its corresponding value in the user object.

for...of Loop
The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like Arrays, Strings, Maps, and Sets, directly accessing the value of each element

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (const value of colors) {
  console.log(value);
}

Explanation:
This loop will output red, then green, then blue, as it directly iterates over the values in the colors array
