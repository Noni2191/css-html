JavaScript has two primary categories of data types: primitive (representing single, immutable values) and non-primitive or reference (representing more complex, mutable values)
Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive Data Type


Primitive types are the most basic data types and are immutable. 

String: Represents textual data and is enclosed in quotes (single, double, or backticks).
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
let name = 'Alice';
let phrase = `The name is ${name}`; // using backticks for template literals

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers
let count = 42;
let price = 19.99;
let notANumber = NaN; // Special numeric value for computational errors

Boolean: Represents a logical entity with only two values: true or false
let isActive = true;
let hasPermission = false;

Undefined: The value automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
let data; // Value is undefined

Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value or object reference. It is an explicitly assigned value.
let user = null; // Explicitly stating no user is assigned yet

Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value often used as an identifier for object properties (introduced in ES6).
const uniqueId = Symbol("id");

BigInt: Represents whole numbers larger than the standard Number type can safely store (introduced in ES2020).
let largeNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; // 'n' at the end indicates a BigInt







Non-Primitive Data Type (Reference Types)
Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities

Object: A collection of key-value pairs. Arrays and functions are technically a type of object.
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30
};

Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of values, indexed by numbers.
let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
let mixedArray = [1, "hello", true];

Function: A block of reusable code that can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments, making it an object type in JavaScript.
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

You can use the typeof operator to check the data type of a value:
console.log(typeof 42);        // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof "hello");   // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof null);      // Output: "object" (a historical quirk of JavaScript)
console.log(typeof {a: 1});    // Output: "object"
