arrow functions

A JavaScript function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions allow developers to organize, modularize, and reuse code, making programs more efficient and easier to debug and maintain. 
The most common way to define a function is with the function keyword, followed by a name, parentheses for optional parameters, and curly braces {} containing the code to be executed.
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Calling the function
let result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 15

In JavaScript, a parameter is a variable listed in a function's definition that acts as a placeholder for a value that will be provided when the function is called. The actual values passed in during the function call are called arguments.
Parameters are used to make functions dynamic and reusable by allowing them to operate on different input data each time they are invoked. 
Definition vs. Invocation: Parameters are part of the function declaration (definition time), while arguments are the actual values supplied when the function is executed (call time).
// 'name' and 'greeting' are parameters
function greet(name, greeting) {
  console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

// 'Alice' and 'Hello' are arguments
greet("Alice", "Hello");



A JavaScript return value is the output a function sends back to the code that called it after completing its task. This value is specified using the return statement, which also immediately stops the function's execution.

Purpose: Return values allow functions to perform calculations or operations and communicate the results to the rest of the program, making code modular and reusable.
Syntax: The return keyword is followed by the value or expression you want to output. For example: return a + b;.
Default Value: If a function does not have an explicit return statement, or if return is used without a value, the function implicitly returns undefined.
Data Types: A function can return a value of any data type, including primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans), objects, arrays, and even other functions.
Single Value Limit: While a function can only return a single value directly, you can wrap multiple values within an array or an object to return them together.
function multiply(a, b) {
  // This line returns the product of a and b
  return a * b; 
  // Any code after this return statement will not run
}

// The returned value (20) is stored in the 'result' variable
let result = multiply(4, 5); 
console.log(result); // Output: 20



JavaScript arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions	

const functionName = (parameters) => expressionOrBlock;


// Traditional function expression
const sumTraditional = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Arrow function (concise syntax)
const sumArrow = (a, b) => a + b;

const calculate = (a, b) => {
  const result = a + b;
  console.log('Calculation complete'); // Multiple statements
  return result;
};
