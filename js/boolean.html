        // Boolean is a data type that can have only two values: true or false. It is often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.
        // let age = 18;
        // let isAdult = age <=14
        // console.log(`The boy is an adult: ${isAdult}`); 

        // Undinfined is a primitive data type that represents the absence of a value. It is the default value of variables that have not been assigned a value, and it can also be explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value.
        // let name;
        // console.log(name);

        // Null is a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value or that an object property is empty.
        // let person = null;
        // console.log(person);

        // Symbol is a primitive data type that represents a unique identifier. It is often used to create unique property keys for objects, ensuring that they do not conflict with other properties.
        // let id1 = Symbol();
        // let id2 = Symbol();
        // console.log(id1 === id2);

        // typeof operator is used to determine the type of a variable or expression. It returns a string that indicates the type of the operand.
