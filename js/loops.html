        // For loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
        // for(let i = 5; i== 5; i++){
            // console.log(i);
        // }

        // While loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It consists of a condition and a block of code to be executed.
        // let i = 10;
        // while (i > 5){
        //     console.log(i);
        //     i--;
        // } 

        // Do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false. It consists of a block of code to be executed and a condition.
